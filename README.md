# Feedback Repository

This repository houses the development of two main components: `feedback-component` and `feedback-dashboard`. These components collectively contribute to enhancing user experience and feedback management within the OpusFlow platform.

## Feedback Component

The `feedback-component` is designed for the SnapFlow Feedback feature. It seamlessly integrates with OpusFlow, empowering users to articulate their experiences and report issues effectively. The component goes beyond traditional feedback systems by allowing users to provide context through screen recordings or captures. By doing so, it facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of user feedback.

### Features
- **Integration with OpusFlow**: The component is tightly integrated with OpusFlow, ensuring a smooth and cohesive user experience.
- **Multimedia Feedback**: Users can submit feedback with additional context through screen recordings or captures.
- **Streamlined Feedback Process**: The component streamlines the feedback process, making it easy for users to express their thoughts and report issues.

## Feedback Dashboard

The `feedback-dashboard` focuses on the development of OpusFlow InsightHub. This is an autonomous web application that serves as a consolidated dashboard for managing user feedback data within OpusFlow. Leveraging integration with Hasura for data management and Linear for task creation, the dashboard provides valuable insights and tools for efficient feedback analysis.

### Features
- **OpusFlow InsightHub**: The dashboard is an autonomous web application dedicated to managing and analyzing user feedback data within OpusFlow.
- **Data Management with Hasura**: Integration with Hasura ensures robust data management, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of feedback data.
- **Task Creation with Linear**: Seamless integration with Linear enables the creation of tasks based on user feedback, streamlining the resolution process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for viewing, filtering, and sorting user feedback data.
